    <h2>The Atom</h2>
    <p className="two_paragraphs_text--first">The atomic structure of matter, at least as a philosophical idea, is known to have started with Leucippus and Democritus (4th century BC). Many centuries passed until the 18th century when Lavoisier (Antoine Laurent Lavoiser), along with a whole series of other scientists, confirmed the correctness of this view through their experiments.</p>
    <h2>Core and Electrons</h2>
    <p className="two_paragraphs_text--first">In the early 20th century, Rutherford (Ernest Rutherford) was able to show that the atom has a very dense, yet relatively small core, while the remaining space of the atom seems empty. The basic experiment he performed was the bombardment of a thin gold foil with alpha particles (which we now know are helium nuclei, He) traveling at very high speeds. While most of these particles passed through the foil with very small deflections, some “turned” back.</p>
    <p className="two_paragraphs_text--first">As Rutherford himself said, “...it was as unbelievable as if you had shot a sheet of paper with a one-inch bullet and the bullet turned back directly and hit you.” The core of the atom is positively charged, and, according to Rutherford, a multitude of (negatively charged) electrons fill the empty space. It was Bohr (Niels Bohr) who came to place the electrons in their “position,” meaning they rotate in circular or elliptical orbits around the nucleus (the electron had already been discovered by Thomson (Joseph John Thomson) a few years earlier). A few years later, quantum theory was already in progress, the dual nature of light (wave-like and particle-like) was considered a given, and De Broglie (Louis De Broglie) introduced the idea that matter could also exhibit wave-like behavior, a hypothesis that was experimentally confirmed. Thus, from around 1920 onwards, the way we “see” elementary particles changed completely, as they can no longer be described as material points with a specific position in space, but as wave functions with a probability of position at a given moment in time.</p>
    <h2>Protons and Neutrons</h2>
    <p className="two_paragraphs_text--first">New experiments in the 2nd and 3rd decades of our century provided the new information that the nucleus of the atom is formed by two types of particles: the proton, with a positive electric charge (equal in magnitude to that of the electron) and the neutron, which has almost the same mass as the proton but is electrically neutral.</p>

    <h2>The 1st Generation</h2>
    <p className="two_paragraphs_text--first">With these elements, we can now describe all of nature, ourselves, and the entire universe. Indeed, today’s science of the structure of matter, the physics of elementary particles, needs only 4 basic building blocks to construct the present world: the up and down quarks, the electron, and additionally a very strange particle, the neutrino. This last one had been predicted by Pauli (Wolfgang Pauli) in 1930, but only in 1956 was its existence experimentally proven.</p>
    <p className="two_paragraphs_text--second">It is an electrically neutral particle, with an astonishingly small mass (in reality, its mass is smaller than the error margin of experimental devices, and theoretically, we treat it as if it has no mass, which is completely acceptable according to the theory of relativity). The neutrino is considered a product of the neutron’s decay. The electron and the neutrino are called leptons (from the word “leptos”). In the first line of the table below, these four basic building blocks of nature are shown with their corresponding electric charges.</p>
    <h2>The 2nd and 3rd Generation</h2>
    <p className="two_paragraphs_text--first">Although these four particles form the matter of the entire current universe, in experiments (and, as we believe, also during the first seconds of the creation of the universe), other particles appear that have striking similarities with the four we just mentioned, and we will call them the 1st generation. Indeed, two more generations of particles appear, each with 2 leptons and 2 quarks. In the 2nd generation, we have the muon (μ) and its own neutrino (different from that of the 1st generation), as leptons, and the charm and strange quarks with charges exactly corresponding to those of the 1st generation (see the table above). The masses of the particles in the 2nd generation are greater than those of the 1st. In the 3rd generation, we find the tau (τ) particle and its neutrino as leptons, and the top and bottom quarks (also called upper and lower). Again, the 3rd generation appears with even greater mass. It is a fact that the existence of three generations, with identical characteristics, remains one of the unanswered questions in the Physics of Elementary Particles. However, experiments support the existence of three and not more generations.</p>
    <h2>Quarks</h2>
    <p className="two_paragraphs_text--first">In the 1960s and 1970s, it became understood, initially theoretically and later confirmed experimentally, that protons and neutrons are not elementary but have an internal structure: they consist of smaller particles called quarks. Quarks come in two types: the up quark and the down quark. Quarks are electrically charged: the up quark has a charge of +2/3, while the down quark has a charge of -1/3. The composite particles that are made of quarks, such as protons and neutrons, are called hadrons. The proton consists of 2 up quarks and 1 down quark, while the neutron consists of 2 down quarks and 1 up quark.</p>
    <h2>... and Antiparticles</h2>
    <p className="two_paragraphs_text--first">Therefore, could we say that a total of 12 particles form the basic building blocks of the universe, from its birth until today? Not exactly! Modern theory describing the microcosm, quantum mechanics, predicts the existence of antiparticles: for each particle, there is a corresponding antiparticle with the same mass and opposite electric charge. Thus, the total number of particles doubles. The existence of antiparticles was theoretically predicted by the English theoretical physicist Dirac in the 1930s. The discovery of the positron (antielectron) gave the first triumph of Dirac's theory. Today, the existence of an antiparticle for every particle has been experimentally proven and constitutes one of the cornerstones of the theory of Elementary Particles. Below is a table showing the elementary particles.</p>
    <h2>From Quarks to Hadrons</h2>
    <p className="two_paragraphs_text--first">Hadrons are composite particles that consist of quarks. The theory governing the interactions of quarks (quantum chromodynamics) predicts which combinations of quarks form the allowed hadrons. Baryons (protons, neutrons, etc.) are formed by combining 3 quarks, while mesons (kaons, pion particles, etc.) are formed by combining 3 antiquarks. More about hadrons (baryons and mesons) and the differences between them and leptons will be discussed later in the study of Interactions.</p>
