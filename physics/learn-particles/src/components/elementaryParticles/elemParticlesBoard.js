    <h2>The Atom</h2>
    <p className="two_paragraphs_text--first">The atomic structure of matter, at least as a philosophical idea, is known to have started with Leucippus and Democritus (4th century BC). Many centuries passed until the 18th century when Lavoisier (Antoine Laurent Lavoisier), along with a whole series of other scientists, confirmed the correctness of this view with their experiments.

    <h2>
        Nucleus and Electrons
    </h2>
    <p className="two_paragraphs_text--first">In the early 20th century, Rutherford (Ernest Rutherford) managed to show that the atom has a very compact, relatively small nucleus, while the rest of the atom's space appears empty. The key experiment he conducted was the bombardment of a thin gold foil with alpha particles (which we now know are nuclei of the element Helium, He) at very high speeds. While most of these particles passed through the foil with very slight deviations, some “bounced” back.
    </p>
    <p className="two_paragraphs_text--first">As Rutherford himself said, “...it was as incredible as if you had fired a one-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and the shell came back and hit you.” The nucleus of the atom is positively charged while, according to Rutherford, a multitude of (negatively charged) electrons filled the empty space. It was Bohr (Niels Bohr) who placed the electrons in their “position,” i.e., revolving in circular or elliptical orbits around the nucleus (the electron had already been discovered by Thomson (Joseph John Thomson) a few years earlier. A few years later, quantum theory was already evolving, the dual nature of light (wave and particle) was considered a given, and De Broglie (Louis De Broglie) introduced the idea that matter could also exhibit wave behavior, a hypothesis that was also experimentally confirmed. Thus, from around 1920 onwards, the way we “see” elementary particles completely changed; they could no longer be described as material points with specific positions in space but as wavefunctions with position probabilities at a given moment.
    </p>
    <h2>Protons and Neutrons</h2>
    <p className="two_paragraphs_text--first">New experiments in the 2nd and 3rd decades of our century provided new information that the atom's nucleus is formed from two types of particles: the proton, with a positive electric charge (equal in absolute value to that of the electron), and the neutron, which has almost the same mass as the proton but is electrically neutral.
