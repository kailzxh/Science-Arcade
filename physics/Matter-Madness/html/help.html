                <h2>Welcome to Matter Madness</h2>
                <p>Explore the exciting world of physics simulations with Matter Madness! This project is made with the matter.js library. Please use a laptop or computer to enjoy all the feautures of this website. However don't worry mobile users as there are still some basic features available for you. Here's a quick guide to help you make the most of your experience:</p>

                    <h2>Creating Objects</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Choose the body type you want to add: Rectangle, Circle, or Polygon.</li>
                        <li>Fill in the body's name, X and Y positions, dimensions (Width and Height), and other
                            advanced
                            options if needed.</li>
                        <li>X and Y Position is supposed to be the center of mass of body.</li>
                        <li>Static option will make the body fixed at a position provided.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Advanced Options:</h2>
                    <p>Advanced options provide more control over your objects. You can:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Change the color of the object using the Color option.</li>
                        <li>Set the restitution (bounciness) value in the "Restitution" input field. Restituion value
                            can
                            lie between 0 to 1.</li>
                        <li>Adjust the angle of the object using the Angle input.</li>
                        <li>Control friction with Friction,Air Friction, and Static Friction settings.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Updating and Deleting Objects:</h2>
                <p>You can also update the properties of object using left sidebar:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can click on the body information on the left side to view the properties of the body.</li>
                    <li>X Scale will widen the object by the factor of input.</li>
                    <li>Y Scale will multiply the height of object by the given input.</li>
                    <li>You can simply click the delete button and the object will be deleted.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Demo:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Click on the demo button to see the demo</li>
                    <li>Unfortunately as of now it isn't possible to make the demo using only functionalities included
                        in the project. </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Exploring the Simulation</h2>
                <p>After adding objects to the playground, you can interact with them to see how they behave under the
                    laws
                    of physics. objects will collide, move, and react in real-time.</p>
