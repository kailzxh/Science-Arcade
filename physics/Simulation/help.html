                <h2>Welcome to marble physics simulation</h2>
                <p>Explore the exciting world of physics simulations with marble physics simulation! This project is made with the venilla js. Please use a laptop or computer to enjoy all the feautures of this website. However don't worry mobile users as there are still some basic features available for you. Here's a quick guide to help you make the most of your experience:</p>

                    <h2>Gravity</h2>
<ul>
    <li>When gravity is enabled, marbles will fall towards the bottom of the screen.</li>
    <li>The marbles will accelerate as they fall, following the laws of gravity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Collision</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Marbles will collide with obstacles and other marbles.</li>
    <li>Obstacles can redirect the marblesâ€™ path based on the angle and position of impact.</li>
    <li>Marbles will bounce off each other, conserving momentum as per the laws of physics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Friction and Bounce</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Marbles will experience friction when moving along surfaces, slowing down over time.</li>
    <li>The elasticity of the marbles determines how much they bounce when they hit surfaces or obstacles.</li>
</ul>

                    <h2>Experiment with Gravity</h2>
<p>Turn gravity on and off to see how it affects the movement of marbles and to create interesting dynamic challenges.</p>

<h2>Obstacle Shapes</h2>
<p>Different shapes of obstacles will affect the marbles in various ways. Use them creatively to manipulate marble trajectories.</p>
